# Machine Learning Techniques on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set

Contributor:
+ Raul Eulogio

I created this repo as a way to get better acquainted with **Python** as a language and as a tool for data analysis. 

I have 2 iterations:
+ breastCancer_MachineLearning
+ breastCancerWisconsin_MachineLearning

I did these two iterations because both data sets were available on the [UCI Machine Learning Database](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). I started the basics of the project in *breastCancer_MachineLearning*, but went into significantly more detail on *breastCancerWisconsin_MachineLearning*. 

Any feedback is welcomed!

Things to do:
+ Create **Python** scripts
+ Explain processes more (pressed for time so left a lot of explanations unfortunately) 

Still a work in progress, but decided to leave both iterations to show different ways my work flow happens and emphasize that iterations make a project go from **okay** to **lit af**
