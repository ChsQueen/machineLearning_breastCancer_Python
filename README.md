# Machine Learning Techniques on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set

**Contributor**:
+ Raul Eulogio

I created this repo as a way to get better acquainted with **Python** as a language and as a tool for data analysis. 

I employed four **Machine Learning** techniques:
+ **Kth Nearest Neighbor**
+ **Decision Tree**
+ **Random Forest**
+ **Neural Networks**

If you would like to see a walk through of the analysis the jupyter notebook includes running code as well as explanations for algorithms and processes. 

For the script I employed a technique I learned from [Nathan Fritter](https://github.com/Njfritter) (thanks homie). It is outlined as such:

The **.py** script is broken into 5 sections (done by creating a function for each section) in the following order:
+ **Exploratory Analysis**
+ **Visual Exploratory Analysis**
+ **Kth Nearest Neighbors**
+ **Decision Tree**
+ **Random Forest**
+ **Neural Networks**

## Running .py Script

To run the script successfully, within the terminal you would employ this technique (Outlined starting at line 618):

To run **Exploratory Analysis** section

	$ python breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py EA

To run **Visual Exploratory Analysis** section

	$ python breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py VEA

To run **Kth Nearest Neighbor** section

	$ python breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py KNN

To run **Decision Tree** section

	$ python breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py DT

To run **Random Forest** section

	$ python breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py RF

To run **Neural Networks** section

	$ python breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py NN

**NOTE**: You can also run it by making script executable as such:

	$ chmod +x breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py

then you would simply just run it (I'll use **Random Forest** as an example)

	$ ./breastCancerWisconsinDataSet_MachineLearning.py RF

## Conclusions
Once I employed all these methods I deduced that **Neural Networks** performed the best in terms of all diagnostics. But when choosing the best model since **Neural Networks** are *black box* models, we don't gain a lot of insight into our data. So in conclusion **Random Forest** was the best model in terms of performance and insight to our data. 

**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: For some reason the values that I receive from the script are different then the values I received from the **Jupyter Notebook** implementation, so I will have to research as to why this is the case. But they performed more or less the same. I also had to change the `random_state` for **Neural Networks** in the script because it was predicting very poorly. 

### Diagnostics for Python Script

| Model/Algorithm | Test Error Rate | False Negative (for Test Set) | Area under Curve (for ROC) | 
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Kth Nearest Neighbor | 4.386% | 4 | 0.960 | 
| Decision Tree | 5.263% | 4 | 0.9480 | 
| Random Forest | 3.509% | 3 | 0.967 |
| Neural Networks | 1.754% | 2 | 0.986 |

### Diagnostics for Jupyter Notebook

| Model/Algorithm 	| Test Error Rate 	| False Negative for Test Set 	| Area under the Curve for ROC | 
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Kth Nearest Neighbor 	| 3.509% |	2 |	0.9627 | 
| Decision Trees 	| 5.263% 	| 4 |	0.9482 | 
| Random Forest 	| 3.509% 	| 3 	| 0.9673 | 
| Neural Networks 	| 2.632% 	| 1 	| 0.9701 |

If you can figure out why values are different for script and notebook please let me know!

Any feedback is welcomed!

Things to do:
+ Research why script results and **Jupyter Notebook** results were different.   

Still a work in progress, but decided to leave both iterations to show different ways my work flow happens and emphasize that iterations make a project go from **okay** to **lit af**
